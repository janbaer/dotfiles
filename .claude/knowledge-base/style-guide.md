# Code Style Guide

> 📝 **Template Note:** Customize this file for your project's specific conventions, or delete sections that don't apply.

This guide defines coding standards and conventions for our project. Consistency makes code easier to read, maintain, and collaborate on.

---

## General Principles

**Clarity Over Cleverness**
- Write code that's easy to understand, not code that shows off
- If it needs extensive comments to explain, it probably needs refactoring
- Choose obvious solutions over clever ones

**Naming Matters**
- Use descriptive names that reveal intent
- Functions and methods should be verbs: `calculateTotal()`, `validateInput()`
- Classes and types should be nouns: `UserAccount`, `OrderProcessor`
- Booleans should read like questions: `isValid`, `hasPermission`, `canEdit`

**Keep It Small**
- Functions should do one thing well
- Classes should have a single, clear responsibility
- Files should be cohesive and focused

---

## Code Organization

**File Structure**
- Group related functionality together
- Keep public interfaces at the top
- Internal/private implementation below
- One primary class/concept per file

**Imports/Dependencies**
- Standard library first
- Third-party libraries next
- Local project imports last
- Alphabetize within each group

---

## Formatting

**Indentation**
- Use consistent indentation (typically 2 or 4 spaces, or tabs—pick one)
- Be consistent across the entire project

**Line Length**
- Aim for 80-120 characters per line
- Break long lines at logical points
- Don't sacrifice readability for line length rules

**Whitespace**
- Use blank lines to separate logical sections
- Add space around operators: `x = a + b` not `x=a+b`
- One statement per line

---

## Comments and Documentation

**When to Comment**
- Explain *why*, not *what*
- Document non-obvious decisions
- Warn about gotchas or edge cases
- Provide examples for complex APIs

**When NOT to Comment**
- Don't explain what the code obviously does
- Don't leave commented-out code (use version control instead)
- Don't apologize for code quality (fix it instead)

**Documentation**
- Public APIs and interfaces need clear documentation
- Include parameter descriptions and return values
- Provide usage examples for complex functionality

---

## Error Handling

- Fail fast and loudly during development
- Provide helpful error messages
- Don't swallow exceptions silently
- Validate input at boundaries

---

## Testing Considerations

- Write testable code (see [testing.md](testing.md))
- Avoid tight coupling to external dependencies
- Make dependencies explicit and injectable
- Keep side effects isolated and obvious

---

## TypeScript Conventions

**Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)

**Testing:**
- Use `Bun`'s built-in test runner when using Bun runtime
- Use `Vitest` or `Jest` when using Node.js
- Use snapshot testing when appropriate for golden master testing
- Focus on unit-level testing
- Test file naming: `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`
- Co-locate tests with source files or use a parallel `__tests__/` directory

**Application Structure:**
- Apps should have a CLI interface when applicable
- CLI enables end-to-end testing from command line
- Keep CLI thin—delegate to domain model and services

**Code Style:**
- Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent formatting
- Enable strict TypeScript compiler options
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use explicit return types for public functions
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object shapes
- Use descriptive variable names (not abbreviated)

**Imports:**
- Runtime built-ins first (with `bun:` or `node:` prefix)
- Bun supports both `bun:` for Bun-specific APIs and `node:` for Node.js compatibility
- Third-party libraries next
- Local project imports last
- Use named exports over default exports
- Alphabetize within each group

**Type Safety:**
- Avoid `any`—use `unknown` when type is truly unknown
- Use discriminated unions for state machines
- Prefer `readonly` for immutable data
- Use strict null checks (`strictNullChecks: true`)

**Example Test Structure (Bun):**
```typescript
// order.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from 'bun:test';
import { Order } from './order';

describe('Order', () => {
  it('should have zero total when empty', () => {
    // Arrange
    const order = new Order();

    // Act
    const total = order.calculateTotal();

    // Assert
    expect(total).toBe(0);
  });
});
```

**Example Test Structure (Vitest/Node.js):**
```typescript
// order.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { Order } from './order';

describe('Order', () => {
  it('should have zero total when empty', () => {
    // Arrange
    const order = new Order();

    // Act
    const total = order.calculateTotal();

    // Assert
    expect(total).toBe(0);
  });
});
```
