# Knowledge Base - Start Here

This knowledge base helps Claude Code understand your development preferences and practices. At the start of each session, share this message:

**"Please read index.md from my knowledge base"**

Claude will read this file and the core references, then work with you using your established practices.

---

## Core Files (Read at Session Start)

**Always read these two files at the beginning of each session:**

1. [style-guide.md](style-guide.md) - Your coding standards and conventions
2. [working-agreement.md](working-agreement.md) - How you and Claude collaborate

---

## Reference Files (Read on Demand)

**Read these when the topic comes up during the session:**

- [philosophy.md](philosophy.md) - Your development philosophy and values
- [testing.md](testing.md) - Test-first development and red-green-refactor cycle
- [refactoring.md](refactoring.md) - When and how to refactor code
- [design-patterns.md](design-patterns.md) - Patterns you prefer to use
- [domain-language.md](domain-language.md) - Project-specific vocabulary and terms
- [decisions.md](decisions.md) - Key architectural and design decisions

---

## When to Reference Each File

| File | Read When... |
|------|--------------|
| working-agreement.md | Starting any session |
| philosophy.md | Discussing approach or making design decisions |
| testing.md | Writing tests or discussing test strategy |
| refactoring.md | Code needs improvement or restructuring |
| design-patterns.md | Solving a design problem or choosing an approach |
| domain-language.md | Discussing domain concepts or naming |
| decisions.md | Understanding why something was built a certain way |

---

## Keeping Your Knowledge Base Current

Update these files as you:
- Discover new preferences
- Establish new patterns
- Make important decisions
- Learn from mistakes
- Refine your process

A living knowledge base grows with your project and partnership.

---

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Be specific** - The more concrete your guidelines, the better Claude can follow them
2. **Update regularly** - Add new learnings and decisions as they emerge
3. **Keep it concise** - Each file should be under 400 words
4. **Focus on differences** - Document what's unique to your approach, not universal practices
5. **Reference explicitly** - When something important comes up, ask Claude to "read testing.md" or reference the relevant file
