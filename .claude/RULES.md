# Rules for Claude code
 
## Commit Message Guidelines

- Always ask for commit messages with the ticket number (VERBU-12345) at the beginning of each commit message
- Use memory-mcp to track commit message guidelines

## Permissions

- Whenever you need to ask me for a permission, ask me for scope where I want to store my decisions in. The most decisions should be stored in the global settings for the user.

## Parallel tasks

- In case you multiple tasks that can be executed in parallel, you can start multiple instances of your self (claude) to run the tasks faster. You should not run more than 10 instances of your self.
