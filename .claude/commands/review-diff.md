description: Review the diff between the current feature and the master or main branch

Review the diff based on the commits I made since creating this feature branch

If there are no staged changes, inform the user that there's nothing to review

## Best Practices for Reviews

- Check if it's a Node.js project and if yes, if the `package.json` supports `yarn test` and `yarn lint` command. If yes, please check, if both are running fine.
- Check the changes for best practises based on the type of project
- Check for possible security issue
- Please don't spoil the developer, give your honest opinion what you don't like but also tell, how it could be better.
