Create a commit for the currently staged changes. Follow these steps:

1. Run `git status` to see what files are staged
2. Run `git diff --staged` to see the actual changes that will be committed
3. Analyze the changes and create an appropriate commit message that:
   - Summarizes the nature of the changes
   - Start the commit messages with the name of the identified component that was changed, like nvim. But not add what kind of change it was, like `feat, fix, bug`
   - Is concise but descriptive
   - Never add comments like `Generated by Claude` or `Generated by Claude AI`
   - use emoji conventional commit format
4. Show the generated message to the user in a code block format and say: "Here's the proposed commit message. Do you want to continue?"
5. If the user wants to continue, run `git commit`
6. Confirm the commit was successful with `git status`

If there are no staged changes, inform the user that there's nothing to commit.

 # Git Commit : Well Formatted Commits

## Best Practices for Commits

- **Verify before committing**: Ensure code is linted, builds correctly, and documentation is updated. Make sure to run ALL of the pre-commit checks first.
- **Present tense, imperative mood**: Write commit messages as commands (e.g., "add feature" not "added feature")
- **Concise first line**: Keep the first line under 72 characters
- **Emoji**: Each commit type is paired with an appropriate emoji:
  - ✨ `feat`: New feature
  - 🐛 `fix`: Bug fix
  - 📝 `docs`: Documentation
  - 💄 `style`: Formatting/style
  - ♻️ `refactor`: Code refactoring
  - ⚡️ `perf`: Performance improvements
  - ✅ `test`: Tests
  - 🔧 `chore`: Tooling, configuration
  - 🚀 `ci`: CI/CD improvements
  - 🗑️ `revert`: Reverting changes
  - 🧪 `test`: Add a failing test
  - 🚨 `fix`: Fix compiler/linter warnings
  - 🔒️ `fix`: Fix security issues
  - 👥 `chore`: Add or update contributors
  - 🚚 `refactor`: Move or rename resources
  - 🏗️ `refactor`: Make architectural changes
  - 🔀 `chore`: Merge branches
  - 📦️ `chore`: Add or update compiled files or packages
  - ➕ `chore`: Add a dependency
  - ➖ `chore`: Remove a dependency
  - 🌱 `chore`: Add or update seed files
  - 🧑‍💻 `chore`: Improve developer experience
  - 🧵 `feat`: Add or update code related to multithreading or concurrency

# Using Jira ticket number

In case the Jira ticket number was given as argument, the commit message will be prefixed with the ticket number.
If the ticket number is not given, check the current branch name, if you can get the ticket number can be taken from it.
The ticket number always starts with `VERBU-` followed bu 5 numbers.
If not, it might not be a Jira related commit, so just create the commit message without the ticket number.
