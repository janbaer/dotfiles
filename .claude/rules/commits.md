# Git commit rules

- Commit messages should always start with a ticket number, but only if the current directory is in a sub-directory of a directory with the name `check24`.
- The ticket number always starts with `VERBU-` followed bu 5 numbers.
- If git current branch is a feature branch, you can guess the ticket from the branch-name.
- Never add any AI attribution comments in commit messages. This includes:
  - `Generated by Claude` or `Generated by Claude AI`
  - `Co-Authored-By: Claude` or similar co-author lines
  - Any other references to AI assistance
  - Commit messages should appear as if written entirely by the human author
